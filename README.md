# Konsi Backend challenge

The challenge summarizes in built a web crawler to get information from a website, but in this challenge I figured out a better and easier strategy to get these data, using the API that website uses, because it's built with [Ionic framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework) and in SPA projects it's normal to call an API.

## Run project in development

In the project directory, you can create a `.env` file and copy data from `.env.example` and is yout wan't you can modify the values.

After you can run the command:

`npm run start:dev`

To run the app in the development mode.

## Build the project

First run:

`npm run build`

And

`npm run start:prod`

To start a server that serves the built solution from `build` folder.
